The assignment requires developing a PHP and MySQL-based web application for booking IT training sessions during welcome week. The application should allow students to select a topic, choose a session time, and enter their name and email on a single web page. It validates names and emails using PHP, checks session availability, and prevents double booking. The application should display booking confirmations or error messages, and output a table of all bookings. The database tracks session details, capacities, and bookings. No JavaScript (beyond form submission) or superglobals should be used, and security measures against code injection must be implemented.
